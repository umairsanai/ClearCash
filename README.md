# 💳 ClearCash: An E-Wallet Web App

**ClearCash** is a simple yet feature-packed **e-wallet web app** built completely from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with **no external libraries or frameworks**.  

Inspired by modern digital banking apps like **NayaPay** and **SadaPay**, ClearCash helps you **organize your money** by creating virtual **“Pockets”**, separate mini-wallets for different spending categories. This makes budgeting easier and keeps your finances neatly divided.
